## Install

In order to reproduce the same results as the ones from the article, from PostgreSQL CLI, after connecting to a fresh created database, one can import the data, using the database.sql:

```
\i database.sql
```

One can also generate new data by using the create_database.sql, in order to experiment with different data distributions. As with the previous script, a database has to be created before importing the script:

```
\i create_database.sql
```
